For supervised learning, I have trained a model based on 4 features: "GDP_per_capita", "Schooling", "Alchol_consumption", "Total expenditure"(which is medical expenditure, as explained in Kaggle)
I used the caret package for the linear regression algorithm, just because chatGPT said so :) 
You can import the R_workspace, change the values of the "new_data" object and then run the prediction again to see the results.
