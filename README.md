For supervised learning, I have trained a model based on 4 features: "GDP_per_capita", "Schooling", "Alchol_consumption", "Total expenditure"(which is medical expenditure, as explained in Kaggle)
I used the caret package for the linear regression algorithm, just because chatGPT said so :) 
You can import the R_workspace, change the values of the "new_data" object and then run the prediction again to see the results.

For supervised learning, I intend to include the following steps:
1. Some data exploration
2. Feature selection
3. Split the data into training and test data

We also have to take care of the time factor. The time factor effectively makes the data panel data. So to get a statistically reasonable solution, without complicating things, we may have to consider limiting the data to just one year of data.
